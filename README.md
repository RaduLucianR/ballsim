# Physics simulation of ball collisions

With Java and LWJGL.

**Beware** that running `gradle run` from a VS Code terminal on (Ubuntu) Linux makes the GLFW window to not work
properly (i.e. doesn't have close/resize buttons and can't be resized with the mouse). Use a standard terminal instead.
The GLFW window is the window created by the graphics library GLFW.
